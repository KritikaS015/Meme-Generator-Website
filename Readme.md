## Project Purpose

The purpose of the "Meme Generator" project is to provide users with a fun and interactive tool to create custom memes by combining images with personalized text captions. This application allows users to select from a variety of popular meme templates or upload their own images, and then add, position, and style text dynamically using an intuitive interface. The project demonstrates my ability to integrate and manipulate user-generated content using JavaScript, create a responsive and user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS, and handle real-time updates efficiently. It also showcases my proficiency in implementing features like image uploads, text styling, and canvas manipulation. Additionally, this project highlights my capability to deliver engaging and creative web applications that work seamlessly across different devices.
